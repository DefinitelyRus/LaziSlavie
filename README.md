# Discord LazySlavey

## Description
    A multipurpose Discord bot with several features such as a string-to-PDT calculator, google search, among others. This project will use Discord.py API to function.
    
## Features
### Text-based Calculator
    The text-based calculator featured in LazySlavey is directly stolen from a dedicated console applet.

    It takes string as input, checks every character, removes all invalid characters, groups numbers and operators inside strings in a list, scans for operators, does operations in order using PEMDAS, then outputs the result.
### Google Search
    This google search module relies on another module called googlesearch. The code here is purely for compatibility with __init__.
### Random reponse (yesno, fishbowl, rps, d6, d20, megarps, russianroulette)
    All RNG-based applets belong in this category. All the possible options are categorized in lists stored in a module called listlist.py.
    It simply chooses a random item in a list and outputs the result. Some (like fishbowl and russianroulette) involve more code to work as intended.
### Games
    > There are currently no games made for this bot. Planned games are as follows:
    * 100-level mini-RPG game
    * Tictactoe
    * Keep talking and nobody explodes
    * Uno
