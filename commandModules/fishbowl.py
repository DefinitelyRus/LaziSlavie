This is a python module for all commands involving fishbowl.

Fishbowl is a list of items added by members.
They can add and remove items from the fishbowl as they wish.
The bot can randomly choose from the list and either remove a
single item or empty the list upon choosing.

A list locker is planned where individual members can have a list of their own.
